    "  - on dry paved roads, the wheels will travel a distance very close to the expected circumference of the wheel\n",
    "  - roads with lots of bumps also create problems for odometry because we are assuming the car travels a straight distance in the direction of its heading\n",
    "    - in reality, with a bumpy road the car is traveling much of its distance, not in a straight line, but up and down\n",
    "  - on a road with lots of turns wheel odometry works well because even though the heading of the car is changing, it's still moving the expected distance in the direction of its yaw\n",
