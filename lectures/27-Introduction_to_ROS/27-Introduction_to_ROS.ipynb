    "- they contain sensors for perceiving the world around them, software for making high level decisions, and motors and controllers for actuation\n",
    "- ROS provides a powerful communications system allowing these different components to communicate with one another\n",
    "- here, we'll introduce this communication system by considering a generic robot\n",
    "  - this robot could be a drone, a mobile base or even a robotic arm\n",
    "  - while these robots may be composed of very different physical components, they are all built to perform these same three high level steps of perception, decision making and actuation\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- on the software side, ROS manages these three complex steps by breaking each of them down into many small Unix processes called **nodes**\n",
    "- typically, each node on the system is responsible for one small and relatively specific portion of the robot's overall functionality\n",

    "- it then allows each node to discover other nodes in the system and establish lines of communication with them\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- in addition to allowing nodes to locate one another and communicate, the ROS Master also hosts what's called the parameter server\n",
    "- the parameter server is typically used to store parameters and configuration values that are shared amongst the running nodes\n",
    "  - for example, a mobile robot's wheel radius may be used by one node to estimate position and by another to calculate speed\n",
