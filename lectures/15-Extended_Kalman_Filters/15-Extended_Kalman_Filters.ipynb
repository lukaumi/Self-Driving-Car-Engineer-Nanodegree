Looking closely at the process noise, we know from the Kalman Filter algorithm that its mean is zero and its covariance matrix is usually noted by $Q∗N(0,Q)$ The first equation only predicts the mean state. As the mean value of the noise is zero, it does not directly affect the predicted state. However, we can see that the noise covariance $Q$ is added here to the state covariance prediction so that the state uncertainty always increases through the process noise."

In this paper, we present a modular framework for tracking multiple objects (vehicles), capable of accepting object proposals from different sensor modalities (vision and range) and a variable number of sensors, to produce continuous object tracks. [...] We demonstrate that our framework is well-suited to track objects through entire maneuvers around the ego-vehicle, some of which take more than a few minutes to complete. We also leverage the modularity of our approach by comparing the effects of including/excluding different sensors, changing the total number of sensors, and the quality of object proposals on the final tracking result.*"

Second, we propose a complete perception fusion architecture based on the Evidential framework to solve the Detection and Tracking of Moving Objects (DATMO) problem by integrating the composite representation and uncertainty management.

Moving objects are detected and reliably tracked in real-time from within a moving car. [...] The focus of this contribution is on oncoming traffic, while most existing work in the literature addresses tracking the lead vehicle. The overall approach is generic and scalable to a variety of traffic scenes including inner city, country road, and highway scenarios. [...] The key idea is to derive these parameters from a set of tracked 3D points on the object’s surface, which are registered to a time-consistent object coordinate system, by means of an extended Kalman filter. Combining the rigid 3D point cloud model with the dynamic model of a vehicle is one main contribution of this thesis.

To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN), most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3D detection network that unifies feature extraction and bounding box prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network. [...] Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that VoxelNet outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3D detection methods by a large margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative representation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging results in 3D detection of pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR.*\n"
