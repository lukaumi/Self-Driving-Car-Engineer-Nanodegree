    "- the code snippet above builds a 50 point path, as in the previous experiment\n",
    "- but this code snippet starts the new path with whatever previous path points were left over from the last cycle\n",
    "- then we append new waypoints, until the new path has 50 total waypoints\n",
    "- using information from the previous path ensures that there is a smooth transition from cycle to cycle\n",
    "- but the more waypoints we use from the previous path, the less the new path will reflect dynamic changes in the environment.\n",
    "- ideally, we might only use a few waypoints from the previous path and then generate the rest of the new path based on new data from the car's sensor fusion information\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Timing\n",
    "\n",
    "- the simulator runs a cycle every 20 ms (50 frames per second), but your C++ path planning program will provide a new path at least one 20 ms cycle behind\n",
    "- the simulator will simply keep progressing down its last given path while it waits for a new generated path\n",
    "- this means that using previous path data becomes even more important when higher latency is involved\n",
    "- imagine, for instance, that there is a 500ms delay in sending a new path to the simulator\n",
    "- as long as the new path incorporates a sufficient length of the previous path, the transition will still be smooth\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- a concern, though, is how accurately we can predict other traffic 1-2 seconds into the future\n",
    "- an advantage of newly generated paths is that they take into account the most up-to-date state of other traffic\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setting Point Paths with Latency\n",
    "\n",
    "- as mentioned, your C++ path planner will at the very least be one cycle behind the simulator because the C++ program can't receive and send data on the same cycle\n",
    "- as a result, any path that the simulator receives will be from the perspective of a previous cycle\n",
    "- this might mean that by the time a new path reaches the simulator, the vehicle has already passed the first few waypoints on that path\n",
    "- luckily you don't have to worry about this too much\n",
    "- the simulator has built-in tools to deal with this timing difference\n",
    "- the simulator actually expects the received path to be a little out of date compared to where the car is, and the simulator will consider which point on the received path is closest to the car and adjust appropriately"
