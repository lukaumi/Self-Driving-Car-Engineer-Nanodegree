    "- traffic lights are the first obstacle that we'll focus on\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- the traffic light detection node (`tl_detector.py`) subscribes to four topics:\n",
    "  - `/base_waypoints` provides the complete list of waypoints for the course\n",
    "  - `/current_pose` can be used to determine the vehicle's location\n",
    "  - `/image_color` which provides an image stream from the car's camera\n",
    "    - these images are used to determine the color of upcoming traffic lights\n",
    "  - `/vehicle/traffic_lights` provides the (x, y, z) coordinates of all traffic lights\n",
    "- the node should publish the index of the waypoint for nearest upcoming red light's stop line to a single topic: `/traffic_waypoint`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- for example, if `waypoints` is the complete list of waypoints, and an upcoming red light's stop line is nearest to `waypoints[12]`, then `12` should be published `/traffic_waypoint`\n",
    "- this index can later be used by the waypoint updater node to set the target velocity for `waypoints[12]` to `0` and smoothly decrease the vehicle velocity in the waypoints leading up to `waypoints[12]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- the permanent `(x,y)` coordinates for each traffic light's stop line are provided by the `config` dictionary, which is imported from the `traffic_light_config` file\n",

    "- your task for this portion of the project can be broken into two steps:\n",
    "  - use the vehicle's location and the `(x,y)` coordinates for traffic lights to find the nearest visible traffic light ahead of the vehicle\n",
    "    - this takes place in the `process_traffic_lights` method of `tl_detector.py`\n",
    "    - you will want to use the `get_closest_waypoint` method to find the closest waypoints to the vehicle and lights\n",
    "    - using these waypoint indices, you can determine which light is ahead of the vehicle along the list of waypoints\n",
    "    - the code to publish the results of `process_traffic_lights` is written for you already in the `image_cb` method\n",
    "  - use the camera image data to classify the color of the traffic light\n",
    "    - the core functionality of this step takes place in the `get_light_state method` of `tl_detector.py`\n",
    "    - there are a number of approaches you could take for this task\n",
    "    - one of the simpler approaches is to train a deep learning classifier to classify the entire image as containing either a red light, yellow light, green light, or no light\n",
    "    - one resource that's available to you is the traffic light's position in 3D space via the `vehicle/traffic_lights` topic"
